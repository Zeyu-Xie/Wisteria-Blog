After encountering stricter **content scrutiny** on WeChat in China, I've made the decision to step away from my WeChat official account and embark on **my personal blogging** journey.

In this new chapter of my digital journey, I am committed to upholding the principles of transparency, authenticity, and respect for diverse viewpoints. I invite you to join me on this expedition, as we navigate the vast and ever-evolving landscape of personal blogging together. Through this medium, I hope to foster a sense of community, inspire change, and continue the pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment.
